Welcome to the polybot source code, written in full by ham with some contributions from ashduino101, conqu3red, hippolippo, and arglin kampling

some things to note:

- this code was based on my own bot framework that hasnt been released yet but i am working on it!
- the images folder is not cruital to the functionality of the code, its just there for reference*. (oh yeah the thumbnails folder is because i cant be assed to convert all those images to urls)
- all dependancies are listed in the package.json file.
- the api.json file in the json folder is a full request from speedrun.com, as this bot has integration with the speedrun.com leaderboards.
- the bot uses a quick.db sqlite3 database to store level request cooldowns and store what channels have been paused.
- everything in the thumbnails folder was ripped straight from the game files with permission from the devs.

you are free to rip this code and use some of the stuff in it for your own projects just put my name somewhere in it i dont care if its like on line 394810 of your readme or whatever it would just be appriciated
